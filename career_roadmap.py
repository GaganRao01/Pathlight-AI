    Generates a personalized and actionable career roadmap in a structured JSON format,
    suitable for a rich UI display, based on the provided resume.
    Emphasizes finding valid URLs for resources.
    """
    prompt = f"""
Act as an insightful and encouraging Senior Career Strategist. Based *only* on the detailed analysis of the provided RESUME, create a comprehensive, actionable, and personalized career roadmap presented as a structured JSON object.

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:**

*   **INFER & RECOMMEND:** Analyze skills, experience, projects, education. Infer a logical, ambitious **Next Step Focus Area**. Justify clearly, linking to RESUME evidence.
*   **ACTION-ORIENTED GOALS:** For each timeframe (Short, Mid, Long), provide 3-4 distinct, concrete, actionable goals (skills, projects, certs, networking).
*   **SPECIFICITY:** Avoid vague advice. Be precise (e.g., "Master Pandas/Scikit-learn," not just "Learn Python").
*   **RESOURCES & VALID URLS:** Provide relevant, specific resource names (e.g., "Coursera's Deep Learning Specialization," "AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate"). **CRITICAL: Make a strong effort to find and include a valid, specific, publicly accessible URL (https://...) for each resource.** Use "#" or omit the "url" field ONLY as a last resort if a suitable, specific link cannot be found after a reasonable attempt (e.g., for very generic resources like 'Personal Project Repository' or 'Study Group'). Do NOT provide internal/invalid URLs.
*   **SKILLS BREAKDOWN:** Summarize key Technical and Soft/Leadership skills to develop.
*   **STRUCTURED JSON:** Output ONLY a valid JSON object adhering strictly to the format below. Ensure all strings are correctly escaped. No introductory text, comments, or markdown outside the JSON.

**JSON FORMAT:**
